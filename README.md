## Description

Project is incomplete. It has basic functionality:

- you can start new game (really? just wow!);
- you can set players names;
- logic handles win/draw states;
- it highlight win cells;
- it has restart button.

I used bulma css framework in this project. And it was a mistake. Their site is down 90% of a time. I just can't read documentation. What a joke!

## TODO

- fix UI
- fix UX
- print congratulation message in 'winner' modal
- add logic to play agains bot
- refactor code
